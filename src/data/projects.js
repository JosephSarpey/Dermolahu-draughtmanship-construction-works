    title: "Modern Residential Building",
    description:
      "A flagship modern residential building designed to combine clean contemporary lines with practical family living. The project uses a reinforced concrete frame and a curtain-wall façade with high-performance glazing to maximize daylight while meeting thermal comfort requirements. Interior layouts prioritize flexible open-plan living, acoustic separation for bedrooms, and integrated smart-home systems for energy management. Landscaping includes drought-tolerant native planting, rainwater harvesting for irrigation, and shared amenity spaces such as a rooftop terrace, fitness studio, and secure children’s play area.",

    title: "Urban Office Complex",
    description:
      "This urban office complex delivers a highly adaptable workplace environment across multiple floors, designed to foster collaboration and support hybrid working models. Structural measures include long-span steel framing to create column-free zones, raised access floors for mechanical and IT services, and a double-skin façade for improved daylight control and energy efficiency. The development integrates biophilic design elements—indoor planting, green walls, and daylight atria—to improve occupant wellbeing and productivity. Supporting infrastructure includes secure tenant parking, bicycle facilities, a central loading bay, and ground-floor retail to activate the street frontage.",

    title: "Eco-Friendly Housing Plan",
    description:
      "A sustainable housing development that places environmental performance and community resilience at the core of its design ethos. The masterplan clusters homes to preserve open space, orients buildings for passive solar gain, and specifies high-insulation envelopes and thermally broken window systems to reduce heating and cooling demand. Renewable technologies include rooftop photovoltaic arrays, solar thermal for hot water, and provision for future battery storage; stormwater is managed on-site with bioswales and permeable paving to reduce runoff. Social sustainability is addressed through shared gardens, community orchards, and flexible home layouts that adapt to changing household needs over time.",

    title: "Commercial Plaza",
    description:
      "A vibrant commercial plaza crafted to be a mixed-use destination combining retail, dining, and public space to encourage pedestrian activity throughout the day and evening. The design arranges storefronts around a central piazza with seating, water features, and event spaces for markets and performances. Whole-building systems focus on ease of maintenance and tenant fit-out flexibility: modular MEP risers, generous ceiling heights on lower floors, and standardized storefront modules to shorten leasing turnaround. Wayfinding, universal accessibility, and nighttime safety are integrated through layered lighting, clear circulation routes, and intuitive signage, enhancing visitor experience and tenant performance.",

    title: "Modern Villa",
    description:
      "A contemporary villa project that blends indoor-outdoor living with a strong focus on materiality and craftsmanship. The house sits within a private landscaped courtyard, using natural stone, timber cladding, and large sliding glass doors to create seamless transitions between living areas and the garden. Passive design strategies—cross-ventilation, deep shading, and thermal mass—reduce reliance on mechanical cooling, while high-efficiency glazing and insulation maintain comfort year-round. Detailed attention to built-in furniture, bespoke lighting, and integrated audiovisual systems delivers a refined residential experience aimed at long-term durability and low maintenance.",

Construction emphasizes cost-effective, repeatable building systems with high-quality finishes, energy-efficient boilers and insulation, and provisions for on-site recycling and composting. Transport planning prioritizes safe pedestrian and cycle routes to schools and retail nodes, with phased infrastructure deployment to support incremental growth and maintain resident quality of life during construction.",
